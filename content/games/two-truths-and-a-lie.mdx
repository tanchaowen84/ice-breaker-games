## Why it works

Two Truths and a Lie is a timeless classic because it scales to any group size, keeps everyone talking, and takes almost no preparation. Participants share a pair of true statements and one fabricated statement about themselves; the rest of the group guesses which statement is false.

## Facilitation steps

1. Ask everyone to take a quiet minute to list two facts about themselves plus one convincing lie.
2. Invite the first person to read their three statements in any order.
3. Let the group discuss and vote on which statement they think is the lie.
4. Reveal the answer, then prompt a short follow-up question to learn more about the true statements.
5. Rotate to the next participant and repeat until everyone has shared.

## Pro tips

- Encourage creativity but keep the statements respectful and inclusive.
- If time is short, split into breakout pairs or trios and run simultaneous rounds.
- Flip the format for a “reverse round” where the group supplies the lie for the guesser.

## Variations to try next

- **Industry Edition** – Require that at least one truth relates to work experience or current projects.
- **Rapid Fire** – Give each person only 30 seconds to present and 30 seconds to guess to maintain energy.
- **Collaborative Twist** – After each reveal, invite the group to brainstorm a shared takeaway or follow-up topic inspired by the truths.
